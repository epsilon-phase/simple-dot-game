# FAQ

## Why did you make this?

Out of determination to experience native rust gui goodness.

## Did you find Rust GUI goodness?

Well, it's a **lot** better than it was last time I looked. Orbtk is a very 
barebones experience right now, but it is far better than it used to be.

The one complaint that I have that isn't just the immature nature of the
library, is that whenever the window closes, it causes my screens to flicker,
and for what you get, it's fairly slow.
