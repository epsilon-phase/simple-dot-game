# FAQ

## Why did you make this?

Out of determination to experience native rust gui goodness.

## Did you find Rust GUI goodness?

Well, it's a **lot** better than it was last time I looked. I'm not decided on
OrbTk honestly

I'm not sure if it's just that I did it all in one file, which never tends to 
help, but right now it feels like I'm struggling with adapting my knowledge of 
gui patterns to an entity component pattern.
